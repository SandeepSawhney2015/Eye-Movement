#Eye Movement

Description: This project was designed to use mouse detection to position the eyes to focus on the mouse as you move around the screen, kind of freaky but amazing!

How to Run: Fork repository then go to settings and click on the link sending you to the website and the program should automatically run!

Future improvements: Create a full face, create expressions with different mouse clicks and hovering over different areas of the face.
